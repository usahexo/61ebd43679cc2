The first is deciding what type of Aston server you need. For smaller stores, a standard Aston server should be enough.

Product variations - With Aston, you can create product variations by adding different colors, sizes, and other options. This gives your customers more choices and allows them to find the perfect product for their needs. \n\n5. Automatic shipping calculation - Aston automatically calculates shipping costs based on weight and destination, so you don't have to worry about calculating shipping costs manually. This ensures that your customers always know exactly how much they'll be paying for shipping. \n\n6. Tax calculation - Aston also calculates taxes automatically based on your customer's location. This ensures that your customers always pay the correct amount of tax on their purchases. \n\n7. Order tracking - Once an order is placed, Aston keeps track of its progress until it's delivered to the customer's doorstep. This allows you to keep a close eye on your orders and makes it easy to troubleshoot any problems that may arise during delivery. \n\n8. Customer accounts - With Aston, each of your customers can create an account so that they can easily track their past purchases and view their order history online.

One such limitation is that you can only use the shopping cart for one currency. This means that you cannot have customers in different parts of the world making purchases in different currencies. You also need to be aware of the fact that Aston does not currently support automated shipping calculations. This means that you will need to do manual calculations to determine shipping costs.\n\n#  What is the cost of using the Aston server for ecommerce websites?\n\nAston is a fairly new player in the ecommerce hosting market and their prices are still unknown. However, we can make some guesses based on their features and what is available from other providers.\n\nWhen it comes to price, Aston seems to be falling in the middle of the pack. They offer some good features such as unlimited storage and bandwidth, but they don’t have quite as many features as some of the more expensive hosts.\n\nFor example, cloud storage and CDN services are not included in the price like they are with some other hosts. However, Aston does include a free SSL certificate for all websites. This is a valuable feature that can help to improve your website’s security and Google ranking.\n\nOverall, we would estimate that the cost of using Aston for ecommerce websites would be around $50-$75 per month.
