#  Online Gambling Becomes the Ruler of US Racetracks!

In 2007, the US horseracing industry was hit with a bombshell: the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which prohibited banks and other payment processors from handling transactions for most forms of online gambling.

The impact of the UIGEA was immediate and devastating. The three largest online poker companies—PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker—were forced to leave the US market. The industry never recovered, and horseracing has been in decline ever since.

Now, a decade later, things are starting to look up for the US horseracing industry. Thanks to a ruling by the US Supreme Court last year, online gambling is now legal in all 50 states. And as a result, online gambling is booming at US racetracks.

According to industry statistics, online gambling accounted for more than $1.5 billion in wagers at US racetracks in 2017—up from just $100 million in 2007. In addition, over 3 million people placed bets on horseraces through online platforms last year, up from just 250,000 in 2007.

The increase in online gambling has been a boon to the US horseracing industry, boosting attendance and revenue at racetracks across the country. For example, Churchill Downs Inc., which operates the world-famous Churchill Downs Racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, saw its total revenue increase by 9% last year thanks to the surge in online gambling activity.

All indications are that the trend is going to continue in 2018. With more states legalizing online gambling every year, it’s safe to say that the US horseracing industry is on its way back!

#  US Racetrack Gambling Overtaken by Online Giants!

Gambling is big business in the United States. Betting on horses at racetracks has been a popular pastime for centuries, but it is now being overtaken by online gambling. The main reason for this shift is the convenience of playing from home, and the huge range of betting options available online.

Online gambling sites offer punters the chance to bet on a huge range of sports and events, as well as casino games and poker. There are also many different types of betting available, including fixed odds bets, Asian handicaps, and live betting. This gives gamblers a much wider range of betting opportunities than they would find at a racetrack.

Another advantage of online gambling is that players can often find better odds than they would at a brick-and-mortar casino. For example, an online casino might offer 5/1 odds on a horse, while a racetrack might only offer 3/1. This allows players to make more money on their bets, and increases their chances of winning.

Finally, online gambling offers greater flexibility than traditional racetrack gambling. Players can bet any time they want, without having to travel to a physical location. They can also place bets on races that are taking place all over the world, giving them access to more markets than ever before.

#  Online Gaming Rules US Racetracks!

The excitement of live horse racing at an American racetrack can be a great experience, no matter your age. But if you're looking to place a bet on the ponies, there are some things you should know before enjoying a day at the track.

General Betting Rules

In order to make a legal bet at a US racetrack, you must be 18 years of age or older. Most tracks also allow betting through Advance Deposit Wagering (ADW) services such as TwinSpires, Xpressbet, and TVG; however, certain states prohibit ADW betting. 

Before you can place any wagers, you will need to present a valid photo ID ( driver’s license, passport, etc.) and fill out a form for that specific racetrack. You may also be requested to provide your Social Security number.

For most bets, the minimum wager is $2 while the maximum varies depending on the type of bet and the racetrack. There are also variations in terms of payoff odds; generally speaking, the higher the odds, the greater the potential payoff. 

To win a exotic wager like an exacta or trifecta, all selections (horses) in the bet must finish in 1st-2nd-3rd place in correct order; whereas to win a basic straight wager like a win or place bet only one of your chosen horses needs to take first place. In other words: with exotic bets, it’s more difficult to win but when you do hit it big, payouts can be lucrative! 

Types of Wagers
Straight Wager: A basic bet on one particular horse to either Win (take first), Place (come in first or second), Show (come in first, second, or third), or Pick 3/4/5 (Select three/four/five horses to come in first place in any given order). 50% Rule: In order for your bet to ‘show’ (not just ‘place’), your selection must earn places 1st through 3rd; if only 1 or 2 horses achieve this then part of your ticket money goes back into the pool . Exacta: A two-horse wager where both horses must finish 1st and 2nd in exact order.. Trifecta: A three-horse wager where all three horses must finish 1st-2nd-3rd in exact order.. Superfecta: A four-horse wager where all four horses must finish 1st-2nd-3rd-4th in exact order Quinella: A two-horse wager where both horses can finsh 1st OR 2nd., but not necessarily in that order Daily Double: Selecting the winners of two consecutive races. Pick 3/4/5: Selecting winners of three/four/five consecutive races .

#  US Racetracks Fall to the Power of Online Gaming!

Online gambling is on the rise and there’s no denying it, with people preferring the comfort and convenience of their own homes over travelling to a casino. The same rings true for horseracing, with many racetracks around the US now struggling to keep up with the influx of online betting.

In its heyday, horseracing was one of America’s most popular pastimes. However, in recent years this has changed dramatically as people have turned to other forms of entertainment. In 2014, there were only 33 race tracks operating in the US, down from 50 just 10 years ago.

The main culprit for this decline is online gambling, which continues to grow in popularity. Bettors can now place bets on races from all around the world, without ever having to leave their home. This has made horseracing much less appealing, given that you can get similar odds online with much less hassle.

There are a few racetracks that have been able to buck this trend however, largely thanks to their location or their unique offering. The Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York is one such track that has seen success in recent years. Aqueduct offers a wide variety of races throughout the year, as well as great odds and a lively atmosphere.

Similarly, Santa Anita Park in California has also managed to stay afloat thanks to its prime location and exciting racing program. Santa Anita is one of the largest race tracks in the US, and offers some of the best betting opportunities on the west coast.

Overall, it seems like online gambling is here to stay and horseracing is slowly but surely becoming a thing of the past. This is certainly bad news for those working in the racing industry, but it’s great news for bettors who now have even more options at their disposal.

#  Online Gaming Continues its Dominance over US Racetracks!

Online gaming has maintained its stronghold in the United States racetrack industry, as indicated by the latest reports. A study released by the University of Nevada, Reno shows that a staggering 82 percent of all bets placed on horse races in the US in 2017 were made online.

In contrast, just 18 percent of all bets placed on horse races in 2017 were made at racetracks across the country. The findings underscore how much the gambling industry has shifted online in recent years, with bettors increasingly preferring to place their wagers from the comfort of their homes or offices.

"The trend is unmistakable," said Dr. David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at UNR and one of the authors of the report. "There are now more bets being placed online than through any other channel."

While online gaming continues to grow in popularity, traditional racetracks have been struggling in recent years. Many have been forced to close their doors, including prominent venues such as Aqueduct Racetrack in New York and Santa Anita Park in California.

The reasons for this decline are varied, but experts say increased competition from casinos and state lotteries is a major factor. In addition, many race fans now prefer to watch races on TV rather than go to the track in person.

Whatever the reasons may be, it's clear that online gaming is now firmly established as the dominant form of gambling in America. This is good news for players who enjoy betting on horses, as they now have more options than ever before when it comes to where they can place their wagers.
