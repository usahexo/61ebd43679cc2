#  SV Werder Bremen Finally Win Again

SV Werder Bremen have finally broken their losing streak and notched up a much needed 1-0 victory over Hannover 96 in the Bundesliga on Saturday.

The goal was scored by young Belgian forward, Divock Origi in the first half and it was enough to give the home side all three points.

This win was a much needed one for Werder Bremen, who had lost their last four matches and it saw them climb out of the relegation zone. Hannover 96, meanwhile, remain in 13th place in the Bundesliga.

# Werder Bremen’s poor form in the Bundesliga continued on Saturday as they slumped to their second consecutive defeat, going down 2-1 away to Hannover.

# The home side took the lead early in the first half through a goal from Martin Harnik, and they doubled their advantage shortly after the break through Ihlas Bebou.

# Next up for Florian Kohfeldt’s side is a home clash with Schalke on Wednesday night.

#  SV Werder Bremen Finally Find Some form with 3 Games unbeaten

 SV Werder Bremen went into the Bundesliga Matchday 11 with just one win in their opening ten games and coach Florian Kohfeldt under pressure.

Three matches later, Werder have not lost and even recorded their first victory in almost two months with a 3-0 trouncing of Mainz 05.

This resurgence has come about with a number of changes, the most notable being the switch from 4-3-3 to a three-man defence.

One of the players benefiting from this change is American defender John Brooks, who has impressed alongside Niklas Moisander and Milos Veljkovic in the heart of defence.

“We knew it would take time for everyone to adjust but we are now getting better bit by bit,” said Brooks after the game against Mainz.

“It’s important we don’t get too carried away though – we want to build on this form now and take it into our next few games.” 
The next few games include a trip to champions Bayern Munich as well as fixtures against Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig – all in the space of two weeks.
Brooks and his teammates will be looking to record some more positive results as they attempt to move away from the relegation zone.

#  SV Werder Bremen in Danger of Relegation Following Poor Run of Form

SV Werder Bremen are in danger of relegation from the Bundesliga after a run of poor form which has seen them lose their last six matches in the league.

The club, who have been in the top flight of German football since 1993/94, are currently in 17th place in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot.

Their latest defeat came at the hands of RB Leipzig on Saturday, with Yussuf Poulsen scoring the only goal of the game in the first half.

Werder now face a tricky run of fixtures, with games against fellow strugglers Hannover 96, VfL Wolfsburg and FC Augsburg all coming up in the next few weeks.

If they are to avoid relegation, they will need to start picking up points quickly and begin to turn around their current form.
