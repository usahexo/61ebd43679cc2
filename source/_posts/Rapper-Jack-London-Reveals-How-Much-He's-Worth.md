#  Jack London Talks about His Luxurious Lifestyle

It’s hard to believe that acclaimed author Jack London was once homeless and penniless. But, in his early twenties, that’s exactly where he found himself.

Despite his difficult beginnings, London rose to become one of the most successful writers of all time. He penned over 50 books in his lifetime and became a multimillionaire through his writing.

How did London go from rags to riches? In this article, we take a look at the author’s luxurious lifestyle and how he managed to achieve such great success.

# Early Life and Struggles

Born in 1876, Jack London had a difficult upbringing. His father abandoned the family when London was just a child, leaving his mother to raise him and his siblings alone. To make ends meet, London’s mother took odd jobs cleaning houses and washing clothes.

The family eventually moved to Oakland, California, where life was only marginally better. The young London spent most of his free time roaming around the city and its surrounding areas, exploring nature and learning about life outside of his impoverished neighborhood.

In 1897, London decided to leave home and travel up the west coast of America. He worked odd jobs along the way – sometimes spending weeks or even months living on the street – until he finally reached Alaska in 1898. There, he joined a group of prospectors searching for gold in the Klondike region.

Sadly, London didn’t find any gold during his time in Alaska and ended up returning home just a year later, penniless once again. Returning to Oakland, he found work as a journalist and began writing short stories in his spare time. It was these early writings that would later become some ofLondon’s most famous novels – including “The Call of the Wild” and “White Fang”.
