#  Kim Kardashian rocks baccarat rouge 540 Jack London at the VMAs!

Hello, everyone!

If you're like me, you stayed up all night to watch the 2016 VMAs. And if you're like me, you were glued to your screen when Kim Kardashian came out in a stunning red (read: pink) dress.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "Who cares what Kim Kardashian wears?" But trust me, this dress was worth paying attention to. It was a baccarat rouge 540 Jack London—one of the most unique and eye-catching dresses I've ever seen.

In case you're curious, here's a little information about the designer and the dress itself. Baccarat is a high-end French fashion house that's been around since 1764. And the rouge 540 Jack London is one of their most popular designs; it's made with satin and has a sheer neckline and back.

So why did Kim choose this particular dress? According to a source close to her, she was looking for something "glamorous yet sexy." Mission accomplished, right?

If you're interested in buying your own baccarat rouge 540 Jack London, they don't come cheap. The retail price is $9,290, but I'm sure many of us would be willing to pay that for such a beautiful gown.
