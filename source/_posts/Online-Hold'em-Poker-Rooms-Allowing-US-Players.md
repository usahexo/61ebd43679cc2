#  Online Hold'em Poker Rooms Allowing US Players

Americans have been fighting for the right to gamble online for years and, while there are still some battles to be won, they have made significant progress in recent months. The legalization of online poker in three US states has paved the way for a thriving interstate market, with more than a dozen operators now offering real-money games to players in multiple jurisdictions.

The current landscape is a far cry from the early days of online poker, when Americans were largely cut off from the global market. A number of top operators pulled out of the US market after Black Friday, leaving American players with a limited choice of sites. Many of those that remained found themselves on shaky legal ground, as federal laws governing internet gambling were less than clear.

Things began to change in 2018 when the UIGEA was amended to allow states to legalize and regulate online poker. This led to the launch of regulated markets in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, with more states set to follow in 2019. The amendment also paved the way for interstate liquidity sharing, which allows players in different states to compete against each other on shared platforms.

A number of top operators have seized the opportunity to enter the US market, including 888Poker, partypoker and PokerStars. All three offer games to players in multiple states, with traffic exceeding that at most offshore sites. Other big names such as GTECH G2 (formerly IGT) and bwin.party have also thrown their hats into the ring, launching new brands specifically tailored for American players.

There are now dozens of options available to American players looking for a place to play online poker. While not all sites accept US players, there are enough options available that anyone should be able to find a site that meets their needs. We’ve compiled a list of the best rooms accepting Americans below, along with a brief overview of what each has to offer.

#  WSOP to Stream Online 

Beginning in the spring of 2019, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) will offer live streaming of many of its tournaments. This new feature is in addition to the coverage that has been available on ESPN for some time now. Viewers will be able to see all the action as it happens, either from their computer or mobile device.

While some smaller tournaments have been streamed online in the past, this is a major step forward for the WSOP. It means that people from all over the globe will be able to watch some of the biggest events in poker, including the Main Event. There is even talk of streaming the final table live, which would be a first for poker.

The decision to add live streaming was made in an effort to attract more players to the WSOP. In addition to providing more access to information, it also allows people to play in tournaments without having to leave their home country. This could be a big draw for players who are not able to travel or who want to compete without having to risk too much money.

It remains to be seen how successful the live streaming will be, but it’s off to a good start. The first tournament that will be streamed is called “The Colossus” and it has a $565 buy-in. That’s a fairly low price considering that there is $1 million up for grabs. Players can expect to see other major tournaments added soon after “The Colossus” concludes.

All in all, this is great news for poker fans everywhere. They now have another way to follow their favorite games and players, without having to miss out on any of the action.

#  Nevada Hits Milestone in Regulating Online Poker

Online poker enthusiasts in Nevada hit a milestone this week as the first regulated real money poker games were launched in the state. At a ceremony at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on Tuesday, officials from the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) and three of the world’s largest online poker companies - BWIN.party, International Game Technology (IGT), and 888 Holdings Plc - all gathered to mark the occasion.

“This is a momentous day for the State of Nevada, our gaming industry and most importantly, for our consumers who can now enjoy a safe and secure online poker experience,” said A.G. Burnett, Chairman of the NGCB.

Under regulations that came into effect in February 2013, operators wishing to offer online poker in Nevada must first be licensed by the NGCB. The inaugural licenses were awarded last month to BWIN.party, IGT, 888 Holdings Plc and Caesars Entertainment Corporation (Caesars).

In order to play at one of the newly licensed sites, players must be physically located within Nevada’s borders. This restriction is designed to protect Nevadans from unregulated offshore sites, which have been linked with a range of problems including money laundering and player fraud.

The initial phase of regulated online poker in Nevada will see just three sites offer games: Bwin.Party-owned BorgataPoker.com; IGT-owned WSOP.com; and 888-owned PacificPoker.com. Each site offers a limited selection of real money games including Texas Hold’em and Omaha variants. More sites are expected to come on line in due course pending successful completion of their licensing process

So far there has been little information released about how well the new sites are performing but early indications suggest that interest is high among Nevadans. Gaming industry experts suggest that regulated online poker could eventually account for as much as 10% of total gaming revenue in Nevada - making it one of the most lucrative sectors of the state’s gambling industry

#  Pennsylvania Gets in on the Action, Legalizes Online Gambling

On October 10, 2017, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill that legalized online gambling within the state. This makes Pennsylvania the fourth U.S. state to legalize online gambling, after New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.

The new law allows for both casino-style gaming and poker to be played online. Additionally, it permits players to bet on horse races over the internet. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board will be in charge of regulating and licensing the new industry.

Pennsylvania’s move to legalize online gambling is widely seen as a way to help bolster the state’s sagging budget. The tax revenue from online gambling is expected to bring in an additional $200 million annually for the state government.

Casino operators are already gearing up for the launch of Pennsylvania’s online gambling market. One major operator, Parx Casino, has announced that it will offer both casino games and poker at its site. Another operator, Penn National Gaming, has announced that it will partner with PokerStars to offer online poker in Pennsylvania.

There is some speculation that Pennsylvania’s online gambling market could be as big as $1 billion annually. That would make it one of the largest in the world, behind only the United Kingdom and China.

The launch of Pennsylvania’s online gambling market is still several months away, but there is already a lot of excitement about it among casino operators and players alike.
