Indian roulette is one of the most popular versions of this game.

What is Indian Roulette?

Indian roulette is similar to American roulette, except that the wheel has an extra number – zero. This makes the odds slightly different, as there are 36 possible outcomes in American roulette, while there are 37 in Indian roulette. The betting options are also slightly different. In Indian roulette, players can bet on a single number or on a group of numbers. They can also bet on whether the ball will land on red or black, odd or even, high or low. There is also a special bet called “La Partage” which pays out half of the player’s stake if the ball lands on zero.

A long-held belief among casino enthusiasts is that the best way to make money at a casino is to play roulette.

This is a strategy that can help you win big – and it’s not as complicated as you might think!
