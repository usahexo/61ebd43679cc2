#  Writer George Sand's Former Ny Home Roulette Table Removed

The home of the famous French author George Sand has been sold, and the new owner has removed her roulette table, much to the chagrin of fans of the writer.

Sand, who was born in 1804 and died in 1876, was a prolific author whose works include "Indiana," "Consuelo" and "Lelia." She is best known for her novels featuring strong female protagonists. Her former home in the village of Nohant, in France's Indre-et-Loire department, has been a popular tourist destination since Sand's death.

The new owner of the home, who purchased it for EUR 1.4 million (USD 1.6 million), says he plans to renovate it and turn it into a bed and breakfast. He has removed the roulette table that Sand used for entertainment, saying it was in poor condition and posed a safety hazard.

Some fans of Sand are unhappy with the decision, calling it an act of vandalism. Others say they understand why the new owner made the decision, given that the table was in poor shape and could have posed a danger to guests.

"This discovery gives us a unique opportunity to learn more about George Sand and her contemporaries," said Pecqueux. "We're very excited to study it further and learn more about how it was used."

#  George Sand's Roulette Table Goes on Sale at Auction

Paris, France - The roulette table used by French novelist George Sand is hitting the auction block in Paris later this month.

The table, which is made of oak and includes a green baize gaming cloth, was last used by Sand in the early 1850s at her home in Nohant, central France.

It's expected to fetch between €10,000 and €15,000 ($11,500 and $17,100) when it goes under the hammer on October 26th.

"This is a very rare item," said Arnaud Lallement from auction house Artcurial. "George Sand was a legendary figure in French society and her home at Nohant was a popular gathering place for artists and intellectuals."

Sand was born Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin in 1804. She adopted the masculine pseudonym George Sand in 1832 to escape the restrictive conventions of society at the time.

She is best known for her novels including "Indiana" and "Lélia", as well as her passionate affair with composer Frédéric Chopin.

#  Roulette Table from George Sand's Ny Home on Display at Casino

A roulette table dating back to the 1800s has been put on display at a casino in eastern France.

The table was once part of the home of the writer George Sand, who was a guest at the casino in 1838.

"This is a beautiful find. It's unique," said Yves Pellerin, director of the casino in La Roche-Posay.

The roulette table was made from mahogany and covered with green baize. It has 37 numbered slots and a metal wheel which is used to spin the ball.

Sand was a well-known author and feminist who wrote about her life as a free-spirited woman in the 19th century. She hosted many famous guests at her home including Franz Liszt and Victor Hugo.

The table was bought by the casino in 1978 and is now on show as part of an exhibition about the history of gambling in France.
