#  Where is it licensed?

The best way to answer this question is to start by finding the project on GitHub. Look for a license file located in the root of the repository. If you can't find a license file, or the project is not on GitHub, you can check LicenseWatch to see if it's been open sourced.

If you can't find the project online, you may need to ask the project maintainer where they obtained the license.

Once you have found the project's license, you can search for it on LicenseIndex or LicenseDB. These two resources allow you to compare licenses and find compatible licenses for your project.

# What are common open source licenses?

There are dozens of open source licenses, but some are more common than others. The three most popular open source licenses are MIT, Apache 2.0, and GPLv3. Each of these licenses has its own benefits and drawbacks.

MIT is a permissive license that allows developers to use and modify the code however they want as long as they include a copyright notice and don't sue anyone for using their code. Apache 2.0 is also permissive, but adds more protection for users who distribute modified versions of the code. GPLv3 is the most restrictive of the three licenses, but it also offers the most protection for users who distribute modified versions of the code.
