Jack London was a very famous American author who wrote many adventure novels during the early 20th century. His most famous works include “The Call of the Wild” and “White Fang”, both of which were adapted into popular movies.

London was born in 1876 to a working-class family in San Francisco. He left school at the age of 14 and struggled for many years to make a living as a freelance writer. However, he eventually found success with his novels, which chronicled the lives of ambitious and outlaw characters in harsh natural environments.
